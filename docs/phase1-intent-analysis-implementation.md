# Phase 1: Intent Analysis Updates - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the discovery refactor plan, optimizing the intent analysis to use exact MCP task names directly without any mapping layer.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Intent Analysis Prompt (`services/claude/prompts/discovery.ts`)
- **Added complete list of 29 MCP tasks** with exact names that Claude must use
- **No mapping required** - Claude outputs exact task names like `receive_webhook`, `send_slack_message`
- **Preserved clarification flow** - Claude still asks for clarification when the END GOAL is unclear
- **Added logic flow analysis** - Traces through trigger → process → output flow
- **Optimized search suggestions** - Provides primary and alternative search terms for gaps

### 2. Response Schema Updates (`services/claude/validation/schemas.ts`)
- **New `intentAnalysisSchema`** with task-based structure:
  - `logic_flow`: Step-by-step workflow logic with task mapping
  - `matched_tasks`: Array of EXACT task names from MCP
  - `unmatched_capabilities`: Gaps that need searching with optimized terms
  - `search_suggestions`: Primary and alternative search terms
  - `clarification`: Optional field for when clarification is needed
- **Kept legacy schema** for backward compatibility

### 3. Type Definitions (`types/claude/responses.ts`)
- **Updated `ClaudeAnalysisResponse`** interface to match new schema
- **Added `LegacyClaudeAnalysisResponse`** for backward compatibility
- **Clear examples** showing task-based responses

### 4. Discovery Prompt Updates
- **Updated to support task-based flow** with pre-configured nodes
- **Separate handling** for task nodes vs searched nodes
- **Clear operation generation rules** for each node type

## Benefits Achieved

### Direct Task Name Usage
```json
// Before: Mapping required
"requiredCapabilities": ["webhook_trigger"],  // Maps to receive_webhook

// After: Direct usage
"matched_tasks": ["receive_webhook"]  // No mapping needed!
```

### Preserved Clarification Flow
- Claude only asks for clarification when the **end goal is unclear**
- Makes reasonable assumptions for tool selection (e.g., "database" → PostgreSQL)
- Provides context and suggestions with clarification requests

### Optimized for Next Steps
The output is perfectly structured for the orchestrator to:
1. Call `get_node_for_task()` for each item in `matched_tasks`
2. Batch search for `unmatched_capabilities` using provided search terms
3. Have Claude select from pre-searched results (minimal tokens)

## Example Output Structure

### Clear Intent Case
```json
{
  "intent": "Receive webhooks and send Slack notifications",
  "logic_flow": [
    {"step": 1, "action": "Receive webhook", "type": "trigger", "task": "receive_webhook"},
    {"step": 2, "action": "Send to Slack", "type": "output", "task": "send_slack_message"}
  ],
  "matched_tasks": ["receive_webhook", "send_slack_message"],
  "unmatched_capabilities": [],
  "search_suggestions": [],
  "workflow_pattern": "trigger-notify",
  "complexity": "simple",
  "clarification_needed": false,
  "reasoning": ["Webhook receives data", "Slack sends notification"]
}
```

### Clarification Needed Case
```json
{
  "intent": "unclear",
  "logic_flow": [],
  "matched_tasks": [],
  "unmatched_capabilities": [],
  "search_suggestions": [],
  "workflow_pattern": "unknown",
  "complexity": "unknown",
  "clarification_needed": true,
  "clarification": {
    "question": "What should happen with the processed data?",
    "context": "I understand you want to process data, but I need to know the desired outcome",
    "suggestions": ["Save to database", "Send notifications", "Generate report"]
  },
  "reasoning": ["End goal is not clear from the request"]
}
```

## Next Steps
The implementation is ready for:
1. **Phase 2**: Create TaskService for fetching task nodes
2. **Phase 3**: Create GapSearchService for optimized searching
3. **Phase 4**: Refactor discovery runner to use new flow
4. **Phase 5**: Update configuration phase to handle pre-configured nodes

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with workflows that use only task templates (e.g., "webhook to Slack")
2. Test with mixed workflows (tasks + custom nodes)
3. Test clarification flow with ambiguous requests
4. Verify exact task names are used without mapping
5. Confirm search suggestions are optimized

## Files Modified
- `/services/claude/prompts/discovery.ts` - Updated prompts for task-based discovery
- `/services/claude/validation/schemas.ts` - New schema for task-based responses
- `/types/claude/responses.ts` - Updated type definitions
- Created this documentation file

## Backward Compatibility
- Legacy schema preserved as `legacyIntentAnalysisSchema`
- Legacy type preserved as `LegacyClaudeAnalysisResponse`
- Discovery prompt supports both old and new formats via context detection
